    "## How to Run the Complete Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you have a complete LLM-as-a-Judge evaluation system! Here's how to use it:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Quick Test (5-10 samples)\n",
    "Test on a small subset first to make sure everything works:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "eval_results = llm_judge_evaluation(eval_data, client, max_samples=10)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: View Sample Results\n",
    "```python\n",
    "display_evaluation_samples(eval_results, num_samples=3, show_incorrect=True)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Full Evaluation\n",
    "Run on all samples (this may take a while):\n",
    "```python\n",
    "eval_results = llm_judge_evaluation(eval_data, client, max_samples=None)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 4: Save and Report\n",
    "```python\n",
    "save_evaluation_results(eval_results, \"my_model_evaluation.json\")\n",
    "print(create_evaluation_report(eval_results))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### What the System Does:\n",
    "1. ✅ Takes each entry from your evaluation dataset\n",
    "2. ✅ Creates a structured prompt for the LLM judge\n",
    "3. ✅ Calls OpenAI API to evaluate if model response matches expected output\n",
    "4. ✅ Parses the judge's verdict (CORRECT/INCORRECT)\n",
    "5. ✅ Calculates overall accuracy percentage\n",
    "6. ✅ Provides detailed explanations for each evaluation\n",
    "7. ✅ Saves results to JSON for further analysis\n"

      "\n",
      "2. Sample #3\n",
      "   Instruction: Describe the following landscape with words...\n",

      "5. Sample #6\n",
